<h1>The Best Movies According to Blow</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Fast 9</h3>
<p>
    I love this movie because it has a lot of action and many of my favorite actors.<br />
    I have watched this movie over 10 times and I never get tired.<br />
    I would definitely recommend this.<br />
</p>

<h3>Deliver Us from Evil</h3>
<p>
    This is the scariest movie I have ever watched.<br />
    It involves a detective and an exorcist fighting demons together.<br />
    The demonic possessions in this film are really so scary.<br />
</p>

<h3>Despicable Me</h3>
<p>
    This is my favorite cartoon. It's so funny and contains some interesting action too.<br />
    There are also some very cute charaters in the movie.<br />
    There are equally very beautiful images.<br />
