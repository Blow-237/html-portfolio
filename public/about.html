<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>ðŸ¤— Welcome! I'm glad you could take some precious time of yours to go through my profile. My name is Emil and I am from Cameroon. 
  I am a native French and English tutor and an experienced language proficiency preparation coach. 
  I have BSc. in Geology and an Msc. in Petroleum exploration.<br />
  I am very friendly, physically healthy, sports-oriented and dedicated to assigned tasks. 
  I am delighted to teach people and help them achieve their learning goals. I love soccer, music, movies and cracking jokes with friends. 
  I love discovery and learning about new facts, cultures, traditions and religion.</p>

<p>I have been teaching languages online for more than 5 years now. I've had the opportunity to deal with students from most parts of the globe, 
  helping them achieve their personal goals in learning a new language. Whether it involves taking a language test such as the TOEFL, IELTS, DELF and DALF, 
  or just wishing to communicate with natives. I've taught kids from 3 years of age, adults of 21 years and above and even seniors of 60 years plus. 
  They fall into the categories of beginners, intermediates and advanced students. <br />
  My teaching methods are very fun, interactive, with several useful games, quizzes activities to help you improve your language and gain confidence as you speak. 
  I know the importance of language in our modern community and the difficulties which come when trying to learn a new language. 
  Most people need a new language for working and schooling abroad, communication with their foreign partners or just to blend in the social community 
  and being able to share and crack jokes with others around us who speak different languages.</p>
